## About

`C_stdlib` is a custom implementation of 25+ functions from the C Standard Library (e.g. `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strchr`).  
This project was part of the 42 School curriculum, where you must adhere to strict style and function-use restrictions to deepen your understanding of low-level C programming.

## Features

- Reimplements core libc functions: memory, string, character, and I/O helpers  
- 100% Norm-compliant: no forbidden functions, 25 lines max per function, 80-column limit  
- Thoroughly tested on edge cases (NULL pointers, zero lengths, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Madm4t/C-stdlib.git
